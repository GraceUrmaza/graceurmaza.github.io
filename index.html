            <li><span>Web Design Goal:</span> To find a balance between showing my artistic voice and providing my audience with the information they came to my website for. It is very important for me to show my artistic voice through my website because it is a one way medium for my audience-potential customers-to understand why I, as an artist and person, am unique in comparison to other artists</li>
